To compile and install PHYLDOG, two libraries are required:
- Bio++
- Boost with MPI enabled

Then the program PHYLDOG can be compiled.

You can find below how the two libraries are to be installed, and then how PHYLDOGS can be compiled.

########################
## Bio++ installation ##
########################

The latest available Bio++ libraries should be installed. To this end, the CVS versions should be used. First, the files must be downloaded, and 
then compiled and installed in the directory INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP (where you want the Bio++ libraries to be installed). The Bio++ installation 
described here uses cmake, as it is the most efficient procedure for installing these libraries.

In a terminal: 
git clone http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/git/bpp-core.git
git clone http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/git/bpp-seq.git
git clone http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/git/bpp-phyl.git


- Compilation of the libraries (beware of the order, it needs to be bpp-core first, then bpp-seq, then bpp-phyl):

cd bpp-core
cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP 
make install

cd ../bpp-seq
cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP
make install

cd ../bpp-phyl
cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP
make install

The Bio++ libraries should now be installed in the directory INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP.

########################
## Boost installation ##
########################

The files must be downloaded, and then compiled and installed in the directory INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BOOST (where you want the libraries to be 
installed). In the directory INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BOOST, both header files (in a "include" directory) and compiled libraries (in a "lib" directory) 
will be installed. In the following lines, I call INCLUDE_DIRECTORY the whole path to the "include" directory (INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BOOST/include), and LIB_DIRECTORY the whole 
path to the "lib" directory (INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BOOST/lib)).

The Boost libraries can be dowloaded from this link:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.47.0/boost_1_47_0.tar.gz/download


In a terminal:
tar zxvf boost_1_47_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_47_0
./bootstrap.sh --libdir=LIB_DIRECTORY --includedir=INCLUDE_DIRECTORY --prefix=INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BOOST --with-libraries=mpi
./bjam install

The Boost libraries should now be installed.


#######################################
##       phyldog compilation         ##
#######################################

Compiling phyldog involves first changing 4 lines in the file "Makefile", and then entering "make phyldog" in the terminal.

The 4 lines to change in the Makefile are at the beginning of the file.

After "BOOST_INCLUDE = ", you should enter the complete path to the Boost "include" directory (i.e. INCLUDE_DIRECTORY above).

After "BIOPP_INCLUDE = ", you should enter the complete	path to	the Biopp "include" directory (i.e. INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP/include).
 
After "BIOPP_LIBRARIES = ", you should enter the complete path to the Biopp "lib" directory (i.e. INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_BIOPP/lib).

After "BOOST_LIBRARIES = ", you should enter the complete path to the Boost "lib" directory (i.e. LIB_DIRECTORY above).

Once these 4 lines have been corrected to correspond to the proper values for your system, typing "make phyldog" in the terminal should compile the program, and produce an executable file "phyldog", ready to run. For indications on how to run phyldog, please read the README file.
