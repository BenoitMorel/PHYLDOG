This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simultaneously build 
gene and species trees when gene families have undergone duplications and 
losses. It can analyze thousands of gene families in dozens of genomes 
simultaneously, and was presented in an article in Genome Research. Trees and 
parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood framework, by maximizing 
theprobability of alignments given the species tree, the gene trees and the 
parameters of duplication and loss.
