This software is a bioinformatics computer program whose purpose is to
simultaneously build gene and species trees when gene families have
undergone duplications and losses. It can analyze thousands of gene
families in dozens of genomes simultaneously, and was presented in
an article in Genome Research. Trees and parameters are estimated
in the maximum likelihood framework, by maximizing theprobability
of alignments given the species tree, the gene trees and the parameters
of duplication and loss.
